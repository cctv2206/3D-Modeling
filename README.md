# 3D-Modeling

This repo contains all source code of homeworks and project in a CAD (Computer-aided design) course.

Homeworks are basic practice for pygame and OpenGL.

Project cuts 3D model into finite layers and outputs contour lines used for 3D printing. Two versions of project provided.

## installation and running
To run the programs, one needs to intall [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/index) and [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) first.

This repo also contains necessary txt files to run the program. So please put python code and txt file in the same directory.

Python programs are written in Python 2 syntax. Change to Python 3 syntax if necessary.

Have fun.
